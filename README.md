# Space-Invader
My Take on a classic 1978 Game

As part of a free course provided by freeCodeCamp.org I have made the classic 1978 blockbuster - "Space Invaders". Most of the game was created under their guidance and instruction but I have also put some of my own features into it to make it even bigger and better. This is my first official project on GITHUB and I am very excited to share with you guys more in the future. Please do let me know what you think of the game itself and let me know if you find an issues or bugs with the game. 

A huge shotuout to freeCodeCamp, FlatIcon and FreePik.com and FreeSound for helping me with the resources I needed for this project. The links to all of these sites will be placed below for use of the audience.
